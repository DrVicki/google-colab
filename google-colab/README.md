# Google Colab

If you want to create a machine learning model but don't have a computer that can take the workload, Google Colab is the platform for you. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use google colab.

## What is Google Colab

Google Colab, short for Colaboratory, is a free cloud-based platform provided by Google that allows users to write and execute Python code collaboratively in a Jupyter Notebook environment. 

***Google Collaboratory notebook***, is designed to facilitate machine learning (ML) and data science tasks by providing a virtual environment, Google colab python with access to free GPU resources.

## Benefits of Google Colab

Google Colab offers several benefits that make it a popular choice among data scientists, researchers, and machine learning practitioners. 

**Key features of Google Collaboratory notebook include**:

- **Free Access to GPUs**: Colab offers free GPU access, which is particularly useful for training machine learning models that require significant computational power.
- **No Setup Required**: Colab runs in the cloud, eliminating the need for users to set up and configure their own development environment. This makes it convenient for quick coding and collaboration.
- **Collaborative Editing**: Multiple users can work on the same Colab notebook simultaneously, making it a useful tool for collaborative projects.
- **Integration with Google Drive**: Colab is integrated with Google Drive, allowing users to save their work directly to their Google Drive account. This enables easy sharing and access to notebooks from different devices.
- **Support for Popular Libraries**: Colab comes pre-installed with many popular Python libraries for machine learning, data analysis, and visualization, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Matplotlib, and more.
- **Easy Sharing**: Colab notebooks can be easily shared just like Google Docs or Sheets. Users can provide a link to the notebook, and others can view or edit the code in real-time.
